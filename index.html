		<h2>About me</h2>
		
		<div class="firstparagraph">
			<p>
			Born and raised in San Diego, CA,<br >
			I moved to Portland, OR in 2014<br > 
			to pursue an education in<br >
			communication sciences and disorders.<br >
			Although this didn't turn out<br >
			to be the field I ended up in,<br >
			I ended up working with children<br >
			under the autism spectrum,<br >
			making a difference in their<br >
			lives as they do mine.

				These children over the years<br >
				have impacted my life,<br >
				teaching me patience and care<br >
				goes into everything that I do...<br >

		<h3>...which is why I started learning how to code!</h3>
		<p>
		I eventually want to make apps<br >
		and games for these kids,<br >
		but lack the skill to currently do so.<br >
		I have to start somewhere, so by<br >
		using tools on the internet,<br >
		I built this personal website!<br >
		</P>

		<p>
		I have experience now building with<br >
		HTML, CSS, jQuery and Javascript,<br >
		and hopefully in time I can<br >
		expand my knowledge to other<br >
		programming languages such as C++,<br >
		C# in the hopes of trying things<br >
		on the Unity engine.
		</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="fourthparagraph">
		<p>In the meantime...<br >
		I also have a YouTube channel<br >
		that showcases science experiments,<br >
		vlogs, and such. This channel is<br >
		something I'm very proud of making.<br >
		Check it out if you have time!</p>
