			<p>
			Born and raised in San Diego, CA,<br >
			I moved to Portland, OR in 2014<br > 
			to pursue an education in communication sciences and disorders.<br >
			Although it didn't become the career path I wanted,<br >
			I currently do work with children under the autism spectrum,<br >
			making a difference in their lives as they do mine.
