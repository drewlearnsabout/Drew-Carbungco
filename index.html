		<div class="firstparagraph">
			<p>
			Born and raised in San Diego, CA,<br >
			I moved to Portland, OR in 2014<br > 
			to pursue an education in communication sciences and disorders.<br >
			Although this didn't turn out to be the field I ended up in,<br >
			I ended up working with children under the autism spectrum,<br >
			making a difference in their lives as they do mine.

				These children over the years<br >
				have impacted my life,<br >

		<h3>...which is why I started learning how to code!</h3>
		<p>I eventually want to make apps and games for these kids,<br >
		so I had to start somewhere, and built this personal website!</p>
